# Floating-point IEEE 754 single precision

**This is my project for the "Embedded & IoT systems design" course**


In this project an RTL multiplier has been created in Verilog, VHDL and SystemC-RTL. It was then integrated into the COM6502-Splatters virtual platform and made in SystemC-TLM in various styles.
